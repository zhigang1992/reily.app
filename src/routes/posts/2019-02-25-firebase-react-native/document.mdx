If one team works on both `react-native` client and backend API, 
we usually prefer to have both codebases in one repo. 

This way, one pull request and have the complete code changes for one feature.

This is especially the case with firebase as backend.

## yarn workspace

To put them in the same repo, the easiest way is to put them in two separate, isolated folders:

- `/client`: the react native app 
- `/firebase`: rest of the stuff

But we can do better with **yarn workspace**, [here is why.](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces#toc-why-would-you-want-to-do-this)

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [ "app", "functions", "web", "scripts" ]
  }
}  
```

Unfortunately, `react-native` does not work well with mono workspace out of the box.    
There are the following issues:

####  Unable to use `react-native link`

Currently `react-native link` would look for packages in `/app/node_modules` and fail,
because it's actually in `/node_modules`.
Thus we can only do manual integrations.

#### Native library search path

Most iOS lib for `react-native` hardcoded Header/Framework search paths,

For example, in [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase), search path look like following

<img width="100%" style={{borderRadius:10, marginBottom: 10}} src={require('./react-native-firebase.jpg')} alt="React Native Firebase Search Path" />

It assumes `node_modules` is located at `app/node_modules`, the same folder where `.xcodeproject` is. So obviously it will not able be to found these frameworks.

Same thing goes for header file search paths.

To fix this only issue, you can:

1. [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) all the native packages' search path.
1. `nohoist` all native packages. (We will talk more about `nohoist` in just a bit).
1. Create a system file link, from `app/ios` to `ios`.

This issue does not apply to android, but on Android, you still need to adjust the path you import in `settings.gradle` 

#### jsBundle location

`react-native` wasn't built to customize jsBundle location, which is why [@brunolemos](https://twitter.com/brunolemos) created [this patch on iOS](https://github.com/devhubapp/devhub/blob/cf8f287d160ae863b5b0415aea6d9be5ee5e6dc9/patches/react-native%2B0.57.4.patch) and [this patch on android](https://github.com/devhubapp/devhub/commit/c51ec020ce6858010513c294148d9fd5d8b0373e) for [devhub](https://devhubapp.com).


These issues are hard to fix and also really hacky, and when `react-native` upgrades, they might break and require a manual upgrade.

So, `nohoist` to the rescue. 

```json{5}
{
  "name": "app",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "nohoist": [ "**" ]
  },
}
```

## husky, lint-staged, prettier

We yarn workspace, it also bring lots of benefits. 
For one, now we only need to configure `husky, lint-staged, prettier` only once on workspace root.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "husky": "^1.3.1",
    "lint-staged": "^8.1.4",
    "prettier": "^1.16.4"
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
      "post-commit": "git update-index -g"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,json,md,ts,tsx}": [
      "prettier --write",
      "git add"
    ]
  }
}
```

It will keep all the code lint and pretty formatted, and more importantly consistent between all the sub-projects

## Share Configuration

Just like `husky, lint-staged, prettier` we can unify `tslint.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

We can have share/common setting in the project root, and then in each subproject.

```json{1}
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  ...
}

```json{1}
{
  "extends": ["../../tslint.json"]
}
```

## Share UI modal

if `web` were to be built with `react-native-web`, then we can have another workspace `common`.

We can build UI and then import it from both `app` and `web`.

## Scripts

The scripts subproject is meant for project house cleaning,
for example, we might need a script to add admin privileges to a certain user.
And we can keep the script around for later use or references.
