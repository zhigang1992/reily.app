## Examples

Let's start with code and see GitHub actions in action. ðŸ˜„

### Mobile app with firebase

```css
workflow "Test on every push" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["TypeCheck", "Lints", "Unit Tests", "e2e Tests"]
}

action "Yarn Install" {
  uses = "docker://node:10"
  runs = "yarn"
  args = "install"
}

action "TypeCheck" {
  needs = ["Yarn install"]
  uses = "docker://node:10"
  runs = "yarn"
  args = "tsc"
}

action "Lints" {
  needs = ["Yarn install"]
  uses = "docker://node:10"
  runs = "yarn"
  args = "tslint"
}

action "Unit Tests" {
  needs = ["Yarn install"]
  uses = "docker://node:10"
  runs = "yarn"
  args = "test"
}

action "e2e Tests" {
  needs = ["Yarn install"]
  uses = "docker://node:10"
  runs = "yarn"
  args = "e2e"
}
```

This will run the tests on every push, including ones in an PR. And if something went wrong, these checks will fail on that PR.

## Comparing over traditional CI infrastructure.

GitHub actions has all the quality of a good CI server:

- Configure as code in version control
- Flexible and scalable container execution

Comparing to other CI solution like Jenkins, Circle, TravisCI, GitHub actions is also much easier to integrate with GitHub.

For one, you no longer need to setup Deploy key or ssh key just to checkout the code. 
It's also much easier to report back to GitHub with in action with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Secondly, configure as code.

You can `use` in a step:

- any docker container
- subfolder in current repo
- any public repo on GitHub

And with the community grow, there are more and more repo on GitHub that you can plug and play.

If you build a useful custom action, simply by extracting into a repo. Other people would be able to use it in their code.
