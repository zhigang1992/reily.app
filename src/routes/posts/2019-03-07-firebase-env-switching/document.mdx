## Why do we need multiple envs

To avoid surprises and unintentional changes on production server.

In general, there are 3 envs:

- **Development**: Deploy cloud functions during development.
- **Staging**: Replica of a production environment for software testing.
- **Production**: Production server!

Here is how we use these envs in our development flow 

- Staring working on a new feature, deploy to development server as needed to test cloud functions on env. 
- Then after we complete the feature, we created a PR on GitHub. 
- And when the PR and reviewed and accepted, code will be automatically deploy to Staging env. 
- Then after it's tested on Staging server, we create a Release on GitHub which triggers GitHub action and deploy to Production.
