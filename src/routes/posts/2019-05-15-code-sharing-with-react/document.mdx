React and react native, they share a lot thing of things including methodology and implementations.

But unfortunately, A web project written in React and a mobile app written in react-native, their code can not be shared directly.

Obviously, since they are all javascript, you can share stuffs like models, api calls, and even state management with redux / mobx.

But to share code on the UI side, you would need react-native-web.

To get started from the ground up and learn the basics,
follow [this awesome tutorial](https://dev.to/brunolemos/tutorial-100-code-sharing-between-ios-android--web-using-react-native-web-andmonorepo-4pej) by [Bruno Lemos](https://github.com/brunolemos).

In this blog, we'll talk about best practise and lessons learnt on this subject.

## Customize-CRA

create-react-app works out of the box with react-web apps, but to get it working with react-native-web there are some tweaking to do.

We uses https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra for better readability and maintainability. 

But you can also write [config-overrides.js](https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo/blob/master/packages/web/config-overrides.js) by hand.

```js
const {
  override,
  babelInclude,
  addBabelPlugin,
  addWebpackPlugin
} = require("customize-cra");
const webpack = require("webpack");

const path = require("path");

module.exports = override(
  addBabelPlugin("react-native-web"),
  babelInclude([path.resolve("src"), path.resolve("../packages/components")]),
  addWebpackPlugin(
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      __DEV__: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
    })
  )
);
```

This will include babel plugin, add `../packages/components` to create-react-app's path. And also define a global variable __DEV__ which is a something that react-native uses.

## StyledComponents

We are using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) in our projects, so to get it working with react-native-web, we need a webpack alias:

```js{4,5}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    'styled-components':
      'styled-components/native/dist/styled-components.native.cjs.js',
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

This way it will load `react-native` version of `styled-components` instead of react-web version.
Without this, `styled-component` will emit `className` instead `style`. [Reference](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/blob/master/packages/styled-components/package.json#L8)

## Custom Font and Vector Icon

To get vector icon working on web, [here](https://github.com/devhubapp/devhub/blob/master/packages/components/src/libs/vector-icons/index.web.ts) is how devhub does it. 

But we just put font file on css and alias the import.

```js{4,5}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    'react-native-vector-icons/AntDesign': 'react-native-vector-icons/dist/AntDesign.js',
    'react-native-vector-icons/Entypo': 'react-native-vector-icons/dist/Entypo.js',
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

```css
...
@font-face {
  font-family: AntDesign;
  src: url('/fonts/AntDesign.ttf') format('truetype');
}
@font-face {
  font-family: Entypo;
  src: url('/fonts/Entypo.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```
  
And also custom fonts

```css
...
@font-face {
  font-family: Montserrat-Black;
  src: url('/fonts/Montserrat-Black.ttf') format('truetype');
}
@font-face {
  font-family: Montserrat-BlackItalic;
  src: url('/fonts/Montserrat-BlackItalic.ttf') format('truetype');
}
...
```

In our approach, `web` and `mobile` projects are two shells that provide similar functionalities. 

We load the font in both shell projects and then we can have the unify behavior (code sharing) in main app.   

## Lottie and LinearGradient

A lot of react-native-web polyfill can be found at https://github.com/react-native-web-community

For example, lottie and linear-gradient.

```js{4,5}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    'react-native-linear-gradient': 'react-native-web-linear-gradient',
    'lottie-react-native': 'react-native-web-lottie',
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

## Backend API and state management

Both react-native and react-native-web come with `fetch` built in. So code sharing in these two department is absolutely 100%.

Only thing that you might need to look out for is CORS on the web. react-native does not have this issue since it's not running in a webview.

## react-native-firebase

If we are using firebase, then you're in luck. Since `react-native-firebase`'s is nearly identical to the web. All you need to do is 

```js{4}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    'react-native-firebase': 'firebase',
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

If you are using https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/reserved-urls to load firebase in the html, you can do

```js
  ...
  addWebpackExternals({
    'react-native-firebase': 'firebase',
  }),
  ...
```

Then all the imports from 'react-native-firebase' will just use global firebase that is loaded in the html.

## Routes

This one is a bit tricky, current navigation standard in react-native is `react-navigation`. But it only has very limited [web support](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/web-support.html).

But luckily, react-native-web works with any navigation library on the web. [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web) for example.

So we need 

`router.tsx` 
```typescript
const OnboardingFlow = createStackNavigator(
  { LoginWithPhone, VerifySMSCode },
  { initialRouteName: 'LoginWithPhone', headerMode: 'none' }
);

const HomeFlow = createStackNavigator(
  { HomePage, ProfilePage },
  { initialRouteName: 'HomePage', headerMode: 'none' }
);

const Root = createSwitchNavigator(
  { OnboardingFlow, HomeFlow },
  { initialRouteName: 'HomeFlow' }
);

export default createAppContainer(Root);

export function useUnifiedNavigation(): {
  navigation: NavigationScreenProp<NavigationRoute>;
  router: RouteComponentProps<any>;
} {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  return {
    navigation,
    router: null as any,
  };
}

```

and `router.web.tsx`.
```typescript
const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" exact component={Dispatcher} />
      <Route path="/onboarding/" component={LoginWithPhone} />
      <Route path="/onboarding/sms" component={VerifySMSCode} />
      <Route path="/profile/" component={ProfilePage} />
      <Route path="/home/" component={HomePage} />
    </Router>
  );
};
export default Routes;

export function useUnifiedNavigation(): {
  navigation: NavigationScreenProp<NavigationRoute>;
  router: RouteComponentProps<any>;
} {
  const router = useReactRouter();
  return {
    router,
    navigation: null as any,
  };
}
```

Then in app logic

```javascript
  const { navigation, router } = useUnifiedNavigation();
  
  return (
    <Button onPress={() => {
      if (navigation != null) {
        navigation.navigate('HomeFlow');
      } else {
        router.history.push('/home/');
      }
    }} />
  )
```

This does come with a price:

- There is no push animation on the web.
- There is no navigation bar on the web, we have to either draw it ourselves or polyfill it.

## async-storage

AsyncStorage was previously in react-native core, but then split out to https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage

So to use it in react-native-web

```js{4, 5}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    '@react-native-community/async-storage':
      'react-native-web/dist/exports/AsyncStorage/index.js',
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

There are more and more component being removed from react-native core and into their own package,
 this here is a rule of thumb to make it work with react-native-web if it doesn't already.

## Animated, react-navigation-fluid-transitions

We can use all the Animated functionalities in react-native-web (without `useNativeDriver` since it doesn't make any sense on web)

We can't use react-native-reanimated on the web yet, but there are other options like https://www.react-spring.io/.

For page transition animations, we can use react-navigation-fluid-transitions on the mobile side.

But since react navigation doesn't work on web, react-navigation-fluid-transitions doesn't work there.

So for web we just jump to next page directly.

But since we are using react-navigation-fluid-transitions for mobile, we need to shim their classes.

```js{4,5, 6}
  ...
  addWebpackAlias({
    ...
    'react-navigation-fluid-transitions': path.resolve(
      './vendor/react-navigation-fluid-transitions.js'
    ),
    ...
  }),
  ...
```

react-navigation-fluid-transitions.js
```js
export const Transition = props => props.children;
```

## Responsive web and iPad

This is not a question related to react-native-web, but rather product.

If you're building a mobile only web app, then you'd don't need to do anything at all.

But if you're building a web app for desktop, then you'd need to do the responsive layout in react-native code.

But after which you'll be getting a native iPad and android tablet version for free.
